# Questions

The questions that I'd like to find out when reading this chapter are
- What is Blockchain?
- When did it get introduced?
- What are blockchain applications and why do we need to care about blockchain?


# The introduction of Bitcoin

* Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with a promise to impact every industry.
* It might take years before the practical benefits come to fruition.
* Proofs of concept using blockchain technology.
* The groundbreaking paper `Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System` under the pseudonym
  Satoshi Nakamoto and introduced the term `chain of blocks`.
